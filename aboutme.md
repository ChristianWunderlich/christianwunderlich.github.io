my name is Christian Wunderlich, i´m working in the tech industry for more than a decade now with my main focus on Microsoft Endpoint Manager, Modern Device Management and the Azure Cloud. Since two years now i´m working for **Microsoft** as a Senior Customer Engineer.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
